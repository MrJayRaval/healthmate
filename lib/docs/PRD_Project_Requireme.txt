Project Title
HealthMate AI – Intelligent Preventive Healthcare Platform

1. Project Overview
HealthMate AI is a cross-platform mobile application built using Flutter that provides AIpowered preventive healthcare assistance. The application focuses on symptom guidance,
lifestyle tracking, personalized health insights, and community health trend analysis
while ensuring user privacy and non-diagnostic medical support.
The system leverages Supabase as the primary backend and database service, with optional
Firebase Cloud Messaging for push notiﬁcations and analytics.

2. Problem Statement
Individuals often lack:
Immediate access to veriﬁed symptom guidance
Awareness of unhealthy lifestyle habits
Data-driven preventive health insights
Simple, multilingual health assistance
This results in delayed action, poor health habits, and misinformation. HealthMate AI
addresses these issues through AI-driven decision support and behavioral analytics.

3. Objectives
Provide AI-assisted symptom urgency guidance
Enable lifestyle tracking and preventive alerts
Deliver personalized health recommendations
Analyze anonymized community trends
Maintain secure and scalable infrastructure

4. Target Users
College students
Working professionals
Senior citizens
Health-conscious individuals
