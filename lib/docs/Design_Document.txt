HealthMate AI — UI/UX Design Speciﬁcation Document
1. Product Vision
HealthMate AI is a mobile-ﬁrst preventive healthcare app with a calm, trustworthy, and
modern design language. The goal is to support users with daily habit tracking, AI symptom
guidance, personalized health insights, and an empathetic AI chatbot through a visually calming,
intuitive interface.

2. UI/UX Principles
These foundational design principles guide every screen and interaction:
1. Clarity: Every screen communicates a clear purpose with minimal cognitive load.
2. Calmness: Soft palette and whitespace to reduce user anxiety.
3. Trust: Professional color combinations familiar to healthcare users.
4. Consistency: Reuse components and spacing patterns to ease navigation.
5. Accessibility: High contrast ratios, large tappable areas, clear typography.

3. Color Palette (Healthcare Theme)
Healthcare design best practices favor cool, calming and trust-evoking colors, especially
blues, greens, and soft purples. See common palettes used in the industry: blue is widely
used for trust & calm, green for healing & growth, and purple for creative, supportive
experiences.
